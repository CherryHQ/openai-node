# OpenAI TypeScript Library (modified by Cherry Studio Team)

This repository is based on [OpenAI-node](https://github.com/openai/openai-node), and the Cherry Studio Team has made several modifications according to the project requirements from [Cherry Studio](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio).

Team members should have direct commit permissions to the master branch. We have agreed on the following:

1. When synchronizing commits from upstream, you may directly commit to the master branch.
2. For functional modifications, submit a pull request and perform a squash merge.
